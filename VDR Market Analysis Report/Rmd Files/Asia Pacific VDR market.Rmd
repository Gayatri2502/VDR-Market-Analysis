  Lower_95 = as.numeric(forecast_arima$lower[,2]),
  Upper_95 = as.numeric(forecast_arima$upper[,2])
)


p <- ggplot(forecast_df, aes(x = Year)) +

  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Lower_95, ymax = Upper_95, fill = "95% Confidence Interval"), alpha = 0.3) +

  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Lower_80, ymax = Upper_80, fill = "80% Confidence Interval"), alpha = 0.5) +

  geom_line(aes(y = Forecast, color = "Forecast"), size = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "ARIMA Forecast of Asia Pacific Market Size", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Market Size (in Millions USD)") +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Confidence Intervals", values = c("95% Confidence Interval" = "lightblue", "80% Confidence Interval" = "lightgrey")) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Forecast", values = c("Forecast" = "blue")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 

ggplotly(p)


```

The ARIMA model forecast illustrates strong growth prospects for the Asia Pacific VDR market over the next five years (2026-2030). The forecast indicates that the market will continue its upward trajectory, with a steady increase in demand. The confidence intervals (80% and 95%) also suggest that the forecast is reliable with a narrow range, further supporting the optimistic growth outlook.

#### Forecasting with SARIMA Model

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(forecast)
library(prophet)
library(keras)
library(tensorflow)
library(timetk)
library(tidyquant)
library(lubridate)

set.seed(123)


years <- 2014:2025
market_size <- c(244.5, 309.3, 389.6, 487.9, 606.1, 745.2, 905.0, 1083.1, 1274.4, 1470.6, 1660.0, 1827.8)

data <- data.frame(Year = years, MarketSize = market_size)

data$Year <- as.Date(paste0(data$Year, "-01-01"))

ts_data <- ts(data$MarketSize, start = c(2014), frequency = 1)

sarima_model <- auto.arima(ts_data)

sarima_forecast <- forecast(sarima_model, h = 5)

forecast_df <- data.frame(
  Year = seq(as.Date("2026-01-01"), by = "year", length.out = 5),
  MarketSize = as.numeric(sarima_forecast$mean),
  Lower = as.numeric(sarima_forecast$lower[,2]),
  Upper = as.numeric(sarima_forecast$upper[,2])
)

combined_data <- bind_rows(
  data,
  forecast_df
)

interactive_plot <- plot_ly() %>%
  add_lines(x = ~data$Year, y = ~data$MarketSize, name = 'Historical Data', line = list(color = 'blue')) %>%
  add_lines(x = ~forecast_df$Year, y = ~forecast_df$MarketSize, name = 'Forecast', line = list(color = 'red')) %>%
  add_ribbons(x = ~forecast_df$Year, ymin = ~forecast_df$Lower, ymax = ~forecast_df$Upper, 
              fillcolor = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2)', line = list(color = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2)'),
              name = '95% Confidence Interval') %>%
  layout(title = "SARIMA Forecast for Market Size (2026-2030)",
         xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Market Size (in millions)"))

interactive_plot



```

The SARIMA model, which takes seasonality into account, offers similar findings, confirming the strong growth trajectory observed in the ARIMA forecast. The forecast highlights that the VDR market will surpass 2000 million USD by 2030, driven by sustained demand for secure data management solutions.
