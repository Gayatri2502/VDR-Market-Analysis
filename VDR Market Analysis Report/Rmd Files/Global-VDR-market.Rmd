## Introduction

The Virtual Data Room (VDR) market has been experiencing significant growth over the past decade, driven by increasing demand for secure online document storage and sharing solutions across various industries. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the global VDR market using historical data from 2014 to 2025. I have used time series forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet to predict future trends and provide insights for strategic decision-making.

### 1. **Global VDR Market Size (2023-2034)**

#### Key Insights:

-   **Strong Growth Potential:** The global VDR market is expected to grow from USD 1,042.8 million in 2023 to USD 7,173.4 million in 2034, representing a **CAGR of 14.2%** from 2020 to 2025.

-   **Slowing Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth:** YoY growth declines gradually over time, from **25.53%** in 2024 to **9.28%** in 2034. This indicates that while the market will expand rapidly, the pace will slow down as the market matures.

## Time Series Modeling

To forecast future market sizes, we convert the data into a time series object and apply various time series models.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Convert data to time series object
vdr_ts <- ts(vdr_data$market_size, start = 2014, frequency = 1)

```

### Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

We perform the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, the time series is non-stationary.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
adf_test <- adf.test(vdr_ts)

adf_test

```

### Differencing to Achieve Stationarity

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vdr_ts_diff <- diff(vdr_ts, differences = 1)

plot(vdr_ts_diff, main = "Differenced VDR Market Size Time Series")

```

ADF Test on Differenced Series\
A lower p-value indicates that the differenced series is stationary.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

adf_test_diff <- adf.test(vdr_ts_diff)
adf_test_diff

```

## ARIMA Model

### Identifying ARIMA Parameters

Using Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to identify suitable ARIMA parameters.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
Acf(vdr_ts_diff, main = "ACF of Differenced Series")
Pacf(vdr_ts_diff, main = "PACF of Differenced Series")
par(mfrow = c(1,1))

```

### Fitting the ARIMA Model

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

arima_model <- auto.arima(vdr_ts)
summary(arima_model)


```

*Model Summary:* The `auto.arima` function suggests an ARIMA model with specific parameters based on the data.

Forecasting with ARIMA

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
arima_forecast <- forecast(arima_model, h = 5)

autoplot(arima_forecast) +
  labs(title = "ARIMA Forecast of VDR Market Size",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Market Size (in million USD)")

```

*Interpretation:* The ARIMA model forecasts a continued increase in market size over the next five years.

## SARIMA Model

Since the data does not exhibit clear seasonal patterns due to annual frequency, SARIMA may not be necessary. However, for demonstration purposes, we can still attempt to fit a SARIMA model.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sarima_model <- auto.arima(vdr_ts, seasonal = TRUE)
summary(sarima_model)


```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sarima_forecast <- forecast(sarima_model, h = 5)

autoplot(sarima_forecast) +
  labs(title = "SARIMA Forecast of VDR Market Size",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Market Size (in million USD)")

```

## Prophet Model

The Prophet model by Facebook is known for handling time series with strong trends and seasonality.

### Preparing Data for Prophet

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(prophet)

prophet_data <- vdr_data %>%
  rename(ds = year, y = market_size) %>%
  mutate(ds = as.Date(paste0(ds, "-01-01"))) # Ensure 'ds' is in Date format


```

### Fitting the Prophet Model

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
prophet_model <- prophet()

prophet_model <- fit.prophet(prophet_model, prophet_data)


```

### Forecasting the Prophet Model

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

future <- make_future_dataframe(prophet_model, periods = 5, freq = 'year')

prophet_forecast <- predict(prophet_model, future)

dyplot.prophet(prophet_model, prophet_forecast)


```

*Interpretation:* The Prophet model predicts a continued growth trend, aligning with previous models.

All models suggest a similar upward trend, indicating confidence in the forecasted growth.
